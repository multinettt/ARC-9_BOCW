# ARC9 BOCW

Early in development weapon pack for [ARC9](https://github.com/HaodongMo/ARC-9)

Because of the sheer size of individual weapons, this pack and repository will be split into different weapon classes in the future.

UPDATE: Pistols will be released to the workshop soon. This repository will be split into different parts. Shared content, attachments and pistols will be ejected and have their own repositories. This big one will stay as the work-in-progress guns.
