The Cavalry Lancer barrel is an attachment type new to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War that acts similar to the Full Metal Jacket attachment from previous titles. It increases the damage multiplier to vehicles and various Scorestreaks. However, unlike FMJ, it only increases the damage multiplier and doesn't increase material penetration]]
