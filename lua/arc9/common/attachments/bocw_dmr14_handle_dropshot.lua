ATT.Description = [[Tightly wrapped fabric bands to improve flinch stability when aiming from different stances.

The Dropshot Wrap is a Handle attachment available for all Primary Weapons, Pistols and Shotguns in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. It decreases flinching from changing stances while also allowing for uninterrupted aiming when changing to prone.

The .410 Ironhide also gains the additional benefit of an increased reload speed and fire rate. The Grav has the Dropshot Handle that functions exactly the same as the standard Dropshot Wrap.]]
