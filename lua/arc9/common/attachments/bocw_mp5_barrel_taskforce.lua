The Task Force barrel is an attachment type available for most Assault Rifles, Submachine Guns, Tactical Rifles, Light Machine Guns, Pistols, and Shotguns in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. For Assault Rifles, Submachine Guns, and Pistols it gives increased damage, effective damage range, and bullet velocity but at the cost of increased overall recoil and the loss of a starting magazine.]]
