The Airborne Elastic Wrap is a Handle attachment available for NATO related Primary Weapons, Pistols, and Shotguns in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. It acts as fusion of the Dropshot Wrap and the SASR Jungle Grip, giving increased aiming speed, flinch resistance, and the ability to aim while going prone, but at the cost of reduced sprint recover speed and movement speed while firing. The Warsaw Pact equivalent is the GRU Elastic Wrap.]]
